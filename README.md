# IC_Engine_designLab
I designed a complete IC Engine using SolidWorks software, starting with the creation of detailed 3D models for each individual component. Following this, I meticulously assembled these parts into a fully functional unit, ensuring precise fit and alignment. Once the assembly was completed, I utilized SolidWorks drawing tools to produce comprehensive technical drawings. These drawings provided an accurate representation of the IC Engine assembly, capturing all necessary details for documentation and further analysis. The project demonstrated my proficiency in SolidWorks and my ability to manage complex design tasks from concept to completion.
